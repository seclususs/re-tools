This directory contains all public C header files (`.h`) that define the  
**Application Binary Interface (ABI)** for the **re-tools core library**  
implemented in Rust.  

These headers enable other applications — including those written in  
**C**, **C++**, and other **C-compatible languages** — to access and use  
the functionality of re-tools.
